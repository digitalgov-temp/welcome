# Welcome!

The DigitalGov program helps government agencies to build and run great digital programs.  This GitHub organization serves to provide a home for open source collaboration for any agency and any federal employee of the U.S. Government.  

The entire GitHub organization - including all repositories, issue trackers, and commits - is public.  This allows the most productive open source collaboration and helps to ensure that all projects understand from the start that they are working in the open.  

## Who's eligible?

Anyone with a government email address from a federal agency is welcome to participate.  

If you're team or agency [already has a GitHub organization](https://github.com/digitalgov/welcome/blob/master/faq.md#how-do-i-see-if-my-agency-already-has-its-own-github-organization), you should prioritize [gaining access](https://github.com/digitalgov/welcome/blob/master/faq.md#my-agency-has-a-github-organization-but-i-dont-know-how-to-request-access-to-it-what-should-i-do) and doing your work in that organization.  If your agency does not yet have a GitHub repo, [you may also be able to start it](https://github.com/digitalgov/welcome/blob/master/faq.md#how-do-i-set-up-a-github-organization-for-my-own-agency)!  

But whether or not your agency has its own, you are welcome to use this GitHub organization for your projects, too.
