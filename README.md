# Welcome!

The DigitalGov program helps government agencies to build and run great digital programs.  This GitHub organization serves to provide a home for open source collaboration for any agency and any federal employee of the U.S. Government.  

The entire GitHub organization - including all repositories, issue trackers, and commits - is public. There are no private repositories.    This allows the most productive open source collaboration and helps to ensure that all projects understand from the start that they are working in the open.
